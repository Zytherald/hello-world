# hello-world
My first anything on git.

Hi, I'm Zytherald. I'm a college student in computer science that is eager to learn more about coding, and hopes to some day
develop artificial intelligences, and work on full-immersion VR projects. In the meantime, I'm trying to learn some swift and 
web dev to wet my feet some more, and maybe start finding more passions; and even job opportunities
